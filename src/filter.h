/// \brief The Filter class provides simple pattern matching.
///
/// Patterns are parsed into tokens of the following type:
///
///   * Any block of non-white space characters seperated by whitespace.
///   * Any block of characters enclosed within double-quotes.
///   * Any of the above, prepended with a '-' symbol.
///
/// If a token begins with a '-' symbol, then the token must not exist in a
/// string for that string to match the filter. Otherwise, the string must
/// contain the token to match the filter.
///
/// For example, for a string to match a filter of "red green -blue", the string
/// must contain the substrings "red" and "green" but must not contain the
/// substring "blue".
///
/// \note Escaping double-quotes is not supported at this time.
